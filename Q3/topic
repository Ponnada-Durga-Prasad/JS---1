// How do arrow functions differ from function expressions in terms of scope and this behavior? Provide an example.

/* 
function expressions are a way of writing functions by assigning it to the varaible and calling the function by that function name,
this function also called anonymous function. in F.E scopes are normally working like block scope, function scope for var, let, const,
F.E has their own this keyword unlike arrow, this in F.E represents window obj

Arrow Functions are also one of the way of writing functions introuduced in es6, the difference between F.E and arrow functions is arrow functiosn don't have their own this keyword.
so it uses its parents this keyword like window object.
