// Discuss how type coercion differs in equality checks (== vs. ===). Provide an example.

/* 
== (loose equality) this is a comparison operator used to check whether both values are equal or not without checking type.

=== (strict equality) this is comparison operator which checks whether two values are equal or not after performing type coercion.

if( 5 == "5") // true, 

if(5 === "5") // false
